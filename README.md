In response to evolving security needs, this project focuses on two key enhancements: implementing a VPN service and upgrading firewalls. Cisco AnyConnect is chosen for its broad OS compatibility and user-friendly interface, providing secure remote access for Contoso's expanding remote workforce. Additionally, upgrading to a Cisco ASA Firewall will bolster defenses against cyber threats with advanced threat detection and seamless integration with existing Cisco infrastructure. These upgrades address the need for robust remote connectivity and comprehensive network security, ensuring both reliable operations and protection against emerging cyber threats.
